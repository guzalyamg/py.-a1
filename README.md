# Checkout Program

assignemt was about writing a code to cashier.  
What it does?, it asks user to enter the item name, its price, quantity. And when you leave the item name like blank, then it stops asking and shows you receipt.  

---

## Now how it works?
The program adds up all the items to get a subtotal, and if the subtotal is 100 or more, it gives a 10% discount,  then adds 6% sales tax on the amount after discount. and at the end, it prints a receipt with the:
   - Number of items
   - Subtotal
   - Discount
   - Tax
   - Total
---

EXAMPLE from the code

Item name (blank for finish): water
Unit price: 50
Quantity: 3
Item name (blank for finish): 
------- RECEIPT -------
items: 1
subtotal: $150.00
discount: $15.00
tax: $8.10
TOTAL: $143.10
